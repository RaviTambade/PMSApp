## Timesheet

A business can meet its deadlines, maintain its budget, and achieve success when it uses time effectively. To do this, you need to be able to keep accurate records. This makes timesheets essential to any successful business.

A timesheet is a data table which an employer can use to track the time a particular employee has worked during a certain period. Businesses use timesheets to record time spent on tasks, projects, or clients. 

## Timesheet Entry

Any company or organization must accurately account for the time its workers spend on tasks and projects. Time entry involves employees entering the time they start and end work on a task or project on a timesheet. This data is then used in client billing as well as payroll processing.

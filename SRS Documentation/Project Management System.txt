Document : System Requirement Specification Document.
Title    : Online Project Management System.

Objective: 
          1.The Online Project Management System Web Application is inteded to provide a 
            sutaible solution for Project Manager and Project team members to creating,
            assigning,completing,updating and finding daily Time Sheet of team members working process.
          2.The ability for manager is to create daily tasks,assigning tasks to team members,
            cheaking timesheet of employees,cheaking updates of tasks from employees,also have ability of
            updating tasks, deleting tasks,deleting team members from projects etc.
          3.The ability for team members is to complete tasks which will assigned by project manager and update 
            task status and aslo have a ability to update their daily time sheet.  
          4.Time sheet management is also provided for recording the amount of team members time spent on allocated job.
            Time sheet management is conventional method of calculating team members performance was done by tabular format using a 
            excel sheet etc.   
          5.At begning, the time sheet was used in fields of payroll calculation and account management.
          6.From time sheet start date and end date of the project can be rrecorded and these statistics can be later used for accounting,
            payrole, billing of client, tracking, estimation and calcutate hours of team members. 

Purpose  :
          1.This documentation specifies the System Requirements Specification(SRS) for the Project Management System(PMS).
            It describes the scope of system,both functional and non-functional requirements for the software,design constraints and system interfaces.
          2.The main purpose of Project Management system is to manage overall things which will be done while project developement.
          3.In this process we can controll the team managers,team members of project, also we can manage or follows time sheet of Team members.
          4.From these Project Management System manager can define daily tasks for team members on these running project and get updates from members about project, and know their time period
            which will working on these project.

Scope    : 
          1.The Project Management System addresses the management of software projects.It provides framework for organizing and managing resources in such a way that these resources deliver all the
            work required to complete a software projects within defined scope,time and cost constraints.
          2.The system applies only to the management of software projects and is tool that facilities decision
            making ; the PMS does not make decisions.
          3.The SRS describes only required functionality of PMS, not the functionality of external systems like 
            data storage, change management or virsion contrl system.
          4.The Project Management System Provides an interface for both Managers and team members in industry to use to track daily ststus of project and time sheet of members which will be working on these project.
          5.The system will allow for management of team members timesheet working in any IT firms.
            Team members will be able to log in and look at their own timesheets,while administrator will able to override worked hours values.
          6.Each User,Manager,Team members have different user interfaces.
          7.The Project manager interface will allow for entering/creating new taskas,provide time period for task,editing previous tasks, deleting tasks,searching tasks,finding timesheet of team members and finding status
            of tasks and project status.Also have a authority to assigning and deleting team members from project.
          8.The team member interface will allow to search task which will be assigned by project manager and aslo have action methods to upload status of project and update their own time sheets of project working. 

Overall Description :
   Current Solution :
                     As for the moment every team leader is using a specific software product or no software at all, for maintaining the project schedule, to organize the tasks of the project and to physically store 
                     the all project data.
   Product Perspective:
                     1.PMS it a standalone system that provides functionality described in the Product functions section. Itincludes all subsystems needed to fulfil these software requirements. In addition, 
                       the PMS hasinterfaces to the external systems, such Version Control System, Change Management and Bug Tracking System and Payroll System. These interfaces shall be implemented according to 
                       available industry standards and shall be independent from a specific external system.
                     2.We have to distinguish a Data Storage System (DSS) from all other external systems in that way, thatData Storage System enables normal functioning of PMS and is therefore essential.
                       PMS stores all itsdata in the DSS and hence has to maintain the connection to it. PMS shall access the data storage system through standard interface (JDBC, ODBS, ADO etc).

# Project Management System

## System Requirement Specification Document

### Online Project Management System

**Objective:**
1. The Online Project Management System Web Application is intended to provide a suitable solution for Project Managers and Project team members to create, assign, complete, update, and find daily Time Sheets of team members' working process.
2. The ability for managers is to create daily tasks, assign tasks to team members, check time sheets of employees, check updates of tasks from employees, also have the ability to update tasks, delete tasks, delete team members from projects, etc.
3. The ability for team members is to complete tasks which will be assigned by the project manager and update task status and also have the ability to update their daily time sheet.
4. Time sheet management is also provided for recording the amount of team members' time spent on allocated jobs. Time sheet management is a conventional method of calculating team members' performance and is done by tabular format using an Excel sheet, etc.
5. Initially, the time sheet was used in fields of payroll calculation and account management.
6. From the time sheet, the start date and end date of the project can be recorded, and these statistics can be later used for accounting, payroll, billing of clients, tracking, estimation, and calculating hours of team members.

**Purpose:**
1. This documentation specifies the System Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Project Management System (PMS). It describes the scope of the system, both functional and non-functional requirements for the software, design constraints, and system interfaces.
2. The main purpose of the Project Management system is to manage overall things that will be done during project development.
3. In this process, we can control the team managers, team members of the project, and also we can manage or follow the time sheet of team members.
4. From this Project Management System, the manager can define daily tasks for team members on these running projects and get updates from members about the project, and know their time period working on these projects.

**Scope:**
1. The Project Management System addresses the management of software projects. It provides a framework for organizing and managing resources in such a way that these resources deliver all the work required to complete software projects within defined scope, time, and cost constraints.
2. The system applies only to the management of software projects and is a tool that facilitates decision-making; the PMS does not make decisions.
3. The SRS describes only the required functionality of PMS, not the functionality of external systems like data storage, change management, or version control systems.
4. The Project Management System provides an interface for both Managers and team members in the industry to use to track the daily status of projects and time sheets of members working on these projects.
5. The system will allow for the management of team members' time sheets working in any IT firms. Team members will be able to log in and look at their own time sheets, while administrators will be able to override worked hours values.
6. Each User, Manager, Team member has different user interfaces.
7. The Project manager interface will allow for entering/creating new tasks, providing a time period for tasks, editing previous tasks, deleting tasks, searching tasks, finding time sheets of team members, and finding the status of tasks and project status. Also, have the authority to assign and delete team members from the project.
8. The team member interface will allow searching tasks assigned by the project manager and also has action methods to upload the status of the project and update their own time sheets of project working.

**Overall Description:**

**Current Solution:**
As for the moment, every team leader is using a specific software product or no software at all, for maintaining the project schedule, to organize the tasks of the project, and to physically store all project data.

**Product Perspective:**
1. PMS is a standalone system that provides functionality described in the Product functions section. It includes all subsystems needed to fulfill these software requirements. In addition, the PMS has interfaces to the external systems, such as Version Control System, Change Management and Bug Tracking System, and Payroll System. These interfaces shall be implemented according to available industry standards and shall be independent of a specific external system.
2. We have to distinguish a Data Storage System (DSS) from all other external systems in that way, that Data Storage System enables the normal functioning of PMS and is, therefore, essential. PMS stores all its data in the DSS and hence has to maintain the connection to it. PMS shall access the data storage system through a standard interface (JDBC, ODBS, ADO, etc).

**User Characteristics:**
There are two kinds of users: Admin/Project Manager as a user and Employee/Team Member is also a user.

**Scalability:**
- The system assesses the highest workloads under which the system will still meet the performance requirements.
- There are two ways to enable your system to scale as the workloads get higher: horizontal and vertical scaling. Horizontal scaling is provided by adding more machines to the pool of servers. Vertical scaling is achieved by adding more CPU and RAM to the existing machines.

## Design

- The system must be programmed in an Object-Oriented language; in this case, we will be using C# (.NET).
- The SQL database must be attached to the system.

## Process

**Start up:**
- Three Options Manager / Employee / New Register.
- Employee & Manager is for login using id, password.
- New Registration Required All fields of Employee & Manager Table

**Manager:**
- First enter into the manager page using the login option.
- Manager allows to create tasks and assigns them to existing employees.
- Manager also allows generating deadlines for task completions using the starting date and end date.
- Manager Interface allows finding any team members' timesheets working on a certain project and finding how much time they utilize on the project working by a team member/employee.
- Project Manager has their own Timesheet for their working.
- Manager also allows editing previous tasks.
- Manager also allows deleting certain tasks

**Employee:**
- Employee first enters the Employee page using the login option.
- Employee has a Dashboard as the first option, in the dashboard, there is a description about the task management system and also gives some Rules for completing certain tasks.
- Again, the Employee has one more option, like Update task.
- In this Update tasks, there is some data present which would be the task given by the manager to this employee.
- In this page, the employee has one option "update" to set the status of the task.
- From this update option, the employee updates the status of the task like Not start/in progress/completed.
- Then, the Employee has a Time Sheet where employees can fill their time working on the project for counting their working hours by the manager for their salary amount counting.
- And the last Employee has one more option Logout.

**Benefits of Project:**
- From this task management project, communication between the employee and the manager will be reduced.
- So the purpose of employees and managers is to save their time for other work.
- Managers can create many working tasks and assign them directly to any employee while sitting in their own office.
- Employees can get their task in their process, which will be assigned by the manager.
- Employee can start working on this and update their task working status simultaneously
- Employees can fill their timesheet, and then the manager can get information directly on project status.
- Also, from the timesheet, managers can easily count working hours of employees for the payment process.
- Managers can get feedback directly on their port.
- From this above project, the working process will get more connection between employees and managers.
- It also increases efficiency in working.

**Purpose of Project:**
- Increasing communication between employees & managers.
- Increasing Productivity.
- Reducing complications between communications.
- Reducing meetings between employees & managers and meetings time.
- Reducing the calculation of working time of every employee from timesheet.

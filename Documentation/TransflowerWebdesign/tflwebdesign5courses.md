Let's break down the key elements of the **Courses Page** in great detail, focusing on both the user experience (UX) and design aspects.

### **1. Hero Section: Course Overview**

At the top of the **Courses Page**, the hero section should immediately communicate the value of your educational offerings.

  Offer a **course preview video** that gives potential students a taste of the course content and what the teaching style is like.

- **CTA (Call to Action)**:
  At the end of the course page, place a **clear CTA** like “Enroll Now,” “Start Course,” or “Join for Free” to guide the user to the next step.

#### **Design Tips**:

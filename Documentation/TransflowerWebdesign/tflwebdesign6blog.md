### **1. Blog Homepage – The Blog Overview Page**

The Blog Homepage should serve as a gateway to all your content, making it easy for users to discover and access posts. The goal is to ensure a seamless experience that encourages users to engage with multiple articles.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Hero Section**:  
  At the top of the blog page, feature a **headline** that emphasizes the value of the content.

    - “Want to dive deeper? Check out our Full Stack Development Course.”
    - “Sign up for personalized mentorship to learn more.”
    - “Comment below if you have questions or thoughts!”

  At the top or bottom of each post, include **social media sharing buttons** (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) to encourage readers to share valuable posts.

- **Comments Section**:  
  Enable a **comments section** so readers can ask questions, share feedback, and engage in discussions. Responding to comments can help build a sense of community.

- **Related Posts**:  
  At the end of each blog post, recommend **related articles** to keep users engaged. For instance:
  - “You might also like…”
  - “Check out our posts on React and Node.js for a deeper understanding of Full Stack Development.”

- **CTA for Lead Generation**:  
  Since you are offering mentorship and courses, include a **lead generation form** at the end of the post. Offer users something in exchange for their email, such as a free eBook, a course discount, or access to exclusive tutorials. This could be a modal or a form below the post.

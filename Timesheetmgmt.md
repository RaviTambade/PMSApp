Timesheet Management
This self-analysis will motivate both you and your employees to do better and avoid any unnecessary and unproductive actions like those well-known “fast and easy” 5-minute jobs many of us are often asked to do. Employees who track time can note how much these extra jobs actually take up their day and be able to make better decisions on whether it’s worth interrupting their workflow.

You have to remember that using time trackers is a two-way street of communication, so it’s best to lead by example. Yes, it gives managers an overview of what their employees are doing during the workday, but it’s also a tool to help employees show their progress and ask for help if needed. Be transparent and honest about implementing a time tracker and take the time to show its benefits. For example, DeskTime lets you set break reminders, encourage private time, and eliminate overworking so your team members feel rested, valued, and safe.
Using DeskTime is a great way to never again get underpaid for the time invested in your clients' projects.

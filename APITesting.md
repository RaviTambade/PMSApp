𝟭. 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: This is like a checkpoint. It makes sure your API does what it should. It checks things like data formats, how errors are handled, and if responses are right, no matter the input.

𝟮. 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Here we test if the API is strong and works correctly. We send different kinds of data to see if each part of the API is working well.

𝟯. 𝗨𝗜 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: This connects the user interface with the API. It checks if what users see on the screen is what the API is actually getting, spotting issues in showing and syncing data.

𝟰. 𝗟𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: This is like a practice run for busy times. It tests how the API handles a lot of users at once, finding any weak spots to make sure it can handle busy times.

𝟱. 𝗥𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲/𝗘𝗿𝗿𝗼𝗿 𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is like a guard dog. It watches your API as it works, catching any errors or strange things that might happen.

𝟲. 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: This is about making your API super safe. It looks for weak spots like chances for unauthorized access or data leaks.

𝟳. 𝗣𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Think of this as friendly hacking. It tries to break into your API on purpose to find and fix security holes before the bad guys do.

𝟴. 𝗙𝘂𝘇𝘇 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: This is a bit wild. It throws all sorts of weird and wrong data at your API to find unexpected weak spots.

𝟵. 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: This makes sure your API plays well with others. It tests if different software and parts can easily connect and talk to your API.

Remember, testing your API is a continuous process. Here are some tips to stay on top:

Use automation tools: They're a big help in making testing easier and faster.

Work with others: Understand what people using your API need and want. This helps make better tests.

Keep records: Write down what you test and the results. This helps you improve over time.
